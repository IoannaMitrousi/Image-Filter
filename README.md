# Image-Filter
In this project we proccess and filter a picture given by the user. We take a picture in PPM format as an input and then we implement several filters (FilterLinear,FilterGamma,FilterBlur,FilterLaplace) which we can apply to the given file. So the output is a filtered version of the original picture saved in the disk.
